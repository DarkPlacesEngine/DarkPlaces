2 bug darkplaces console: figure out how to prevent "alias a a" - infinite loop when executed, this should be detected when executing it (Vicious)
2 bug darkplaces console: review the whole set of console commands and cvars carefully and identify interactions, known interactions include sequences such as +sv_cheats 1 +map e1m1, or +maxplayers 8 +deathmatch 7 +map dpdm2, but for some reason this works with the cvar after the map command, and also if you do -window it does not affect the value saved to config, because the configs are executed again after the -window, perhaps it is not executing the commandline a second time?  apparently also -dedicated without +map does not load a map automatically in transfusion (Wazat, Willis)

2 cleanup darkplaces filesystem: add fs_datapath and fs_userpath cvars to better support Linux, this can be done by making each gamedir add both the basepath and userpath variants of the gamedir, and making sure the userpath one is last so it is used for writing (Mercury)
2 cleanup darkplaces memory: memory pools should be able to be nested multiple levels (Vic)
2 cleanup darkplaces menuvm: change menu qc key input to using string key names instead of numbers (the bind alias names should be able to do this) (Mercury, Black, Vermeulen)

2 feature darkplaces sound: add mapmusic command (<maps/mapname.bsp> <music/whatever.ogg> perhaps, with a blank music name it would simply remove the map from the list of overrides) to manipulate a list of per-map music overrides, mapmusic alone should print the list (Joseph Caporale, tell Static_Fiend)

6 feature darkplaces renderer: add HalfLife2 style water rendering (Mitchell, Stribbs, Jimmy Freestone)
6 feature darkplaces renderer: add cubemap reflections like UT2003 somehow (perhaps entities would define the reflection maps for rooms, and a water entity would take care of the rest?) (TEU, Nexuiz, Sajt)

7 feature darkplaces csqc: add clientside quakec (KrimZon, FrikaC, Sajt)
