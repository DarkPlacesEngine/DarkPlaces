0 bug darkplaces effects: add a cvar to disable colored dlights (leileilol)
0 bug darkplaces effects: dlights don't look anything like quake ones, bring back lightmap dlights as a cvar - with both classic and old dp falloff modes (leileilol)
0 bug darkplaces effects: quake mode blood trails don't have the appropriate slight gravity - there may be other effects missing this also (leileilol)
0 bug darkplaces filesystem: -game nehahra does not load properly; menu does not work properly - probably not activating gamemode
0 bug darkplaces loader: crash when a mdl model has more replacement skins than the model contains (Lardarse)
0 bug darkplaces loader: make rtlight entity loader support q3map/q3map2 lights properly, they use a spawnflag for LINEAR mode, by default they use 1/(x*x) falloff (Carni, motorsep)
0 bug darkplaces loader: mcbsp hull selection is ignoring the custom hulls supported by mcbsp (div0)
0 bug darkplaces loader: png loading crashes if the image is transparent (Urre)

0 bug darkplaces mobile: add a command to lock in current accelerometer axes as default orientation (calibrate), which the menuqc/csqc can call
0 bug darkplaces mobile: add a landscape mode for mobile devices where width is > height, which changes 2D and 3D rendering orientation
0 bug darkplaces qw: tf skins not working (xavior)
0 bug darkplaces readme: it would be a very good idea to add documentation of sv_gameplayfix_* cvars in the readme as a means to run broken mods (xaGe)
0 bug darkplaces readme: readme says that q3 shaders are not supported, this is not true, describe the working features in detail (qqshka)
0 bug darkplaces renderer deferred: scissoring artifacts are very obvious on shadowless lights, turn off scissor (Rock)
0 bug darkplaces renderer: GL13 path has broken handling of unlit surfaces in Nexuiz toxic.bsp - the small red light surfaces are black in GL13 path (m0rfar)
0 bug darkplaces renderer: coronas are not affected by fog (div0)
0 bug darkplaces renderer: if an animated model has transparent surfaces, each one calls RSurf_ActiveModelEntity, recomputing all vertices
0 bug darkplaces renderer: if an animated model is entirely transparent, the RSurf_ActiveModelEntity call updating vertices is completely wasted
0 bug darkplaces renderer: r_speeds counts entities twice with r_hdr 1, the whole counting code probably needs auditing (Morphed, and jim on inside3d)
0 bug darkplaces renderer: rtworld seems to mess up player pants/shirt colors
0 bug darkplaces renderer: sprites with ! in the filename are supposed to receive lighting (Asaki)
0 bug darkplaces server csqc networking: csqc entity sending code does not currently detect packet loss and repeat lost entities (FrikaC, Chris Page, div0)
0 bug darkplaces server qc: trace_dphittexturename should be a static buffer rather than a tempstring, it produces unnecessary warnings currently (div0)
0 bug darkplaces server: SV_PushMove is ignoring model type in its angles_x handling, where as the renderer checks only model type to determine angles_x handling (Urre)
0 bug darkplaces server: SV_PushMove's call to SV_ClipMoveToEntity should do a trace, not just a point test, to support hollow pusher models (Urre)
0 bug darkplaces server: X-Men mod has flying enemies that tend to go through the floor, sometimes preventing a level from being completed.  x1m1 has two alcoves that open to reveal Storm and Archangel but often Storm disappears through the ground of hear alcove and then the level can't be completed.  A similar problem with Storm apears in x1m3 in an alcove.  (ewwfq yahoo com)
0 bug darkplaces server: savegames do not contain parms for multiple players, restoring a savegame leaves parms for other players as they were at the time of loading the savegame, clearly wrong (daemon)
0 bug darkplaces server: savegames do not save precaches, which means that automatic precaching frequently results in invalid modelindex values when reloading the savegame, and this bug also exists in many quake mods that randomly choose multiple variants of a monster, each with separate precaches, resulting in a different precache order when reloading the savegame
0 bug darkplaces wgl client: during video mode setup, sometimes another application's window becomes permanently top most, not darkplaces' fullscreen window, why? (tZork)
0 bug darkplaces windows sound: freezing on exit sometimes when freeing sound buffer during sound shutdown (Black)
0 bug darkplaces windows sound: surround sound fails in windows client, falls back to stereo (greenmarine)
0 bug dpmaster: if server does not reply to queries in a reasonable period of time it should be removed from the list, this is necessary for the server to be removed when it shuts down and sends out two heartbeats to let the master know that it is shutting down, and isn't there to reply to queries (jitspoe, div0)

0 bug dpmod: it is (rarely) possible to die and be unable to respawn
0 bug dpmod: monsters don't properly chase you around corners, this is not an engine bug because they work fine in id1 but not dpmod, the knight at the start of e2m2 makes for good testing by shooting him and then hiding behind the crates (StrangerThanYou)
0 bug dpmod: monsters falling out of level?
0 bug dpmod: monsters shouldn't constantly do sightsounds on a slain player, it's annoying and silly
0 bug dpmod: monsters that spawn underwater shouldn't drown, just because it somewhat breaks the intended behavior of maps
0 bug dpmod: test for any unnamed death messages that might be happening
0 bug dpmod: the id1 map e2m4 has a bug where 4 scrags don't spawn in normal/hard skills because of a mislinked trigger, the Quake Done Quick team figured this out and a trigger_relay with target "t58" should be changed to target "t66" (Lardarse)

0 bug hmap2: handle \" properly in hmap2 cmdlib.c COM_Parse (sort)
0 bug hmap2: the plane-distance based projection size for polygons doesn't work in certain wedge cases where two sides of a wedge brush are very near origin but the entirety of the wedge brush is much larger
0 bug hmap: strip .map extension from filename if present
0 change csqc client: add float in_mouse_centered which indicates the engine should lock the mouse at the center of the window, only gathering relative motion (in_mouse_window_position stops being modified - it is not set to the center as that would be useless)
0 change csqc client: add float in_mouse_keep_in_window which indicates whether engine should be currently restricting the mouse pointer to the window (useful in point and click games such as RTS games)
0 change csqc client: add float in_mouse_show_system_cursor which indicates whether the system mouse pointer should be visible while over the window
0 change csqc client: add svc_updatestatstring, svc_updatestatfloat, and keep 3 cl.stats arrays, of int, float, and string types respectively, store svc_updatestatstring in the string one, store all others in both int and float formats (KrimZon, Chris, Spike)
0 change csqc client: add vector in_mouse_motion which indicates mouse movement since previous frame (even if in_mouse_window_position did not change, such as when in_mouse_centered is on)
0 change csqc client: add vector in_mouse_window_position which indicates cursor position over the game window (real position of mouse in the window) - not updated if in_mouse_centered is true
0 change csqc client: replace input_buttons with in_button0 and similar (matching server qc fields), auto-detect these at load
0 change csqc server: change SendEntity to take the client as "other" rather than a parameter
0 change csqc server: implement packet logging of csqc entities to deal with packet loss
0 change csqc server: replace AddStat with RegisterStat and RegisterStatString, make them send float or string only, with string taking up only one stat slot and being sent using svc_updatestatstring, make it automatically send integer values as svc_updatestat/svc_updatestatubyte and non-integer values as svc_updatestatfloat (KrimZon, Chris, Spike)
0 change csqc server: replace per-entity SendEntity function with a global SV_SendEntity function, because it does not make it sufficiently clear to modders that the .SendEntity function has no special meaning, that an ENT_ constant must be set up, and so on, it would be more clear if there was only a single global SV_SendEntity function, which can still call out to a .SendEntity or whatever if it wishes, but is more likely to do an if else on a .net_type field or similar (Urre)
0 change darkplaces client: disable all possible 'cheat' things unless -developer is given on commandline, this includes r_show*, r_test, gl_lightmaps, r_fullbright, and would require changing -developer to only set developer to 1 rather than 100, as 100 is too annoying
0 change darkplaces client: modify cl_particles_quake to make all the engine dlights be white and look as much like quake as possible (Jago)
0 change darkplaces client: particles shouldn't be using contents checks to decide whether to die, they should use movement traces
0 change darkplaces client: turn off coronas on dlights (Jago)
0 change darkplaces extensions: edit FRIK_FILE documentation to mention that fgets uses its own separate buffer, so only one fgets can be done at a time without uzing strzone, but that this is not true with DP_QC_UNLIMITEDTEMPSTRINGS (FrikaC)
0 change darkplaces extensions: edit FRIK_FILE documentation to mention that strcat uses its own separate buffer, and that a = strcat(a, b);a = strcat(a, c); works correctly despite this, but that strcat is far more flexible with DP_QC_UNLIMITEDTEMPSTRINGS (FrikaC)
0 change darkplaces general: make r_speeds 2 show timings for other subsystems such as client, sound, server, network (Carni)
0 change darkplaces loader: load *lava and *teleport and *rift textures as a black diffuse texture with all the color put into a glow layer, and remove the MATERIALFLAG_FULLBRIGHT accordingly, this way replacement textures can make it not glow (Kedhrin)
0 change darkplaces memory: optimize model loaders to use less individual allocations, especially the q1bsp loader, it is responsible for a lot of very small (1-8 byte) allocations in the memlist all report
0 change darkplaces menu: move all options into a submenu so that people won't keep ignoring the other submenus
0 change darkplaces networking: make darkplaces detect its *public* client port from master server and send that in nq connect messages (wallace)
0 change darkplaces protocol: PRYDON_CLIENTCURSOR should use a stat and .prydoncursor field instead of the cl_prydoncursor cvar, because stuffcmd is a bit icky (FrikaC)
0 change darkplaces protocol: in dp8 protocol change clc_move to include a separate want-prediction flag rather than sending 0 movesequence for unpredicted moves, this will allow the client to know its own ping regardless of whether prediction is used.
0 change darkplaces protocol: increase maxplayers limit to 65535, send maxplayers as an int in the serverinfo packet, send colormap indices as a short, send svc_update* using short player indices (discoloda)
0 change darkplaces protocol: make svc_cdtrack use strings rather than a numbers in next DP protocol, so that named tracks can be used by maps
0 change darkplaces protocol: send origin and angle updates as individual components in entities like Quake did, rather than combined ORIGIN/ANGLE bits like DP5/6/7 do
0 change darkplaces protocol: use q3 print "print message" command packet instead of qw print 'nmessage' command packet? (div0, KadaverJack)
0 change darkplaces prvm: prvm_globals should print values of globals like entity fields do, not just names
0 change darkplaces readme: make sure that cl_capturevideo is documented
0 change darkplaces renderer: add a polygonoffset for rtlight passes to try to work around zfighting issues on mac, this would also change the depthfunc to LEQUAL rather than EQUAL (div0)
0 change darkplaces renderer: rename r_drawportals to r_showportals, and move its declaration to gl_rmain.c, and make it work with r_showdisabledepthtest
0 change darkplaces server: make "viewmodel" command code precache a new model and set it, rather than changing the meaning of the player model
0 change darkplaces server: support sys_ticrate 0 as variable framerate mode
0 change darkplaces: make vid_mouse 0 mouse movement work with menu.dat
0 change dpmod: add a ghostly cvar and change skill 5 code to check it
0 change dpmod: make shamblers be worth 5 frags, shalrath be worth 3 frags, and fiends be worth 2 frags (Zenex)

0 feature darkplaces client particles: effectinfo.txt should have a "particlefont" command specifying a filename, number of cells per row, number of rows, number of bottom rows that are beams, this would allow more particle images to be used (ChrisP)
0 feature darkplaces client rtlights: ChrisP has a suggestion of selecting rtlight properties using the number keys, and increasing/decreasing their value using the mouse wheel (cvars needed for amounts to adjust by), and ability to right click a light to delete it, left click to select a light, left drag to move a light on the XY plane it is on (ChrisP)
0 feature darkplaces client text: support for font rasterizing at pixel-accurate sizes and caching them to disk, support freetype2 for this purpose if it is present (ChrisP)
0 feature darkplaces client: add DP_GFX_EFFECTINFO_TXT to extensions and document it, the feature has been in for a long time, also update wiki.quakesrc.org accordingly
0 feature darkplaces client: add a cl_showspeed cvar to display a hud overlay of your current velocity, speed as length of velocity, and speed along forward vector (Spike)
0 feature darkplaces client: add a cvar to make the renderer use a different entity for pvs than for viewing, this might be useful for a third person camera that should only see what the player sees (Urre)
0 feature darkplaces client: add an alias to control whether the nexuiz logo.dpv splash video plays at startup and whether the menu opens, this way the config can change it before it happens, for instance to disable it, or to set up a similar thing in other games (green)
0 feature darkplaces client: add cvar r_fonttexturenearest to force font textures to be GL_NEAREST sampled and disable the squished-character boxes, although that should be a different cvar (leilei)

0 feature darkplaces editlights: add r_editlights_edit commands for turn/turnx/turny/turnz to allow angle adjustments using binds (Kedhrin)
0 feature darkplaces editlights: split rtlight drawshadows option into drawworldshadows and drawentityshadows options, this allows combinations like no world shadows (for speed) but still having entity shadows (Mitchell, romi, Kedhrin)
0 feature darkplaces loader: add hud_clearprecache and hud_precachepic commands to preload pics by name, these get reloaded by r_restart as well, mods can put a lot of these commands in their default.cfg to precache needed hud art (Tomaz)
0 feature darkplaces loader: load .vis files produced by hmap2
0 feature darkplaces menu: add r_shadow_glsl_offsetmapping cvars to menu (Kedhrin)

0 feature darkplaces protocol: add TE_LASER effect with values Entity owner Vector start Vector end Byte palettecolor Byte startalpha Byte endalpha Byte beam width (in quake units) Byte lifetime (0-255 for 0-1 seconds), skin index (looking up a gfx/particles/beam%03i.tga), it fades from startalpha to endalpha over time (Wazat, Vermeulen)
0 feature darkplaces protocol: add a .fatness field which enlarges models along their vertex normals, this won't work on bsp models or sprites, label this as FTE_PEXT_FATNESS in the extensions string (Dresk)
0 feature darkplaces protocol: add a .scalexyz field which would allow non-uniform scaling of models, and may requires upgrading some lighting code but I am not sure (Dresk)
0 feature darkplaces protocol: add a new TE_ explosion effect with RGB color choice for particle color and another choice for light color (VorteX)
0 feature darkplaces protocol: add an EF_BULLETTRACER trail effect which can be used to make an invisible entity into a tracer, a bright streak leaving a faint smoke trail (Carni)

2 bug darkplaces collision: use larger of model box or collision box for linking into areagrid so that bullet tracing can use the model bounding box instead of the collision one?  (Urre)
2 bug darkplaces console: figure out how to prevent "alias a a" - infinite loop when executed, this should be detected when executing it (Vicious)
2 bug darkplaces console: review the whole set of console commands and cvars carefully and identify interactions, known interactions include sequences such as +sv_cheats 1 +map e1m1, or +maxplayers 8 +deathmatch 7 +map dpdm2, but for some reason this works with the cvar after the map command, and also if you do -window it does not affect the value saved to config, because the configs are executed again after the -window, perhaps it is not executing the commandline a second time?  apparently also -dedicated without +map does not load a map automatically in transfusion (Wazat, Willis)
2 bug darkplaces csqc: does csqc entity player movement prediction work?  what does the EXT_CSQC spec say about retrieving move history for a replay in csqc code?  (Spike)

2 cleanup darkplaces console: make commandline parsing use COM_ParseToken - why?
2 cleanup darkplaces console: make sure the engine uses only the first 32 special chars, so the high set can be replaced, this means player messages should not be shifted up, and the 'shift down' printing in dedicated server consoles should be removed, etc (Urre)
2 cleanup darkplaces filesystem: add fs_datapath and fs_userpath cvars to better support Linux, this can be done by making each gamedir add both the basepath and userpath variants of the gamedir, and making sure the userpath one is last so it is used for writing (Mercury)
2 cleanup darkplaces memory: memory pools should be able to be nested multiple levels (Vic)
2 cleanup darkplaces menuvm: change menu qc key input to using string key names instead of numbers (the bind alias names should be able to do this) (Mercury, Black, Vermeulen)

2 feature darkplaces renderer: q3 fog brush shaders (tZork)
2 feature darkplaces renderer: use occlusion query extension (if supported) for testing corona visibility instead of traceline - curve collisions are dragging down corona performance in some maps (Vermeulen, Riot)

2 feature darkplaces sound: add FLAC sound support (Anton Romanov)
2 feature darkplaces sound: add mapmusic command (<maps/mapname.bsp> <music/whatever.ogg> perhaps, with a blank music name it would simply remove the map from the list of overrides) to manipulate a list of per-map music overrides, mapmusic alone should print the list (Joseph Caporale, tell Static_Fiend)
2 feature dpmod: add observer mode and a best N of (N-1)*teams+1 match system (carni)
2 feature dpmod: write a readme for the menu progs code to get people started with it, and know what is and is not possible, what builtins do, etc (Urre)

2 optimization darkplaces collision: do trace against patch bbox before testing triangles
2 optimization darkplaces renderer: move skybox/skysphere render to after sky polygons, so that they can do a depth comparison to draw only on the sky polygons, using DepthRange(1,1) and DepthFunc(GL_GREATER), note though that portal renders will need half depth range (Mercury)

3 bug dpmodel: fix dpmodel to compile v_HKmp5-sd (tell Riot)
3 change darkplaces client: GAME_NEXUIZ: implement new hud and scoreboard based on http://www.quirkybastards.net/qmods/scoreboard.jpg except with deaths instead of lives, and map name instead of "be the last one alive" and remove the time string and map string at the bottom, instead showing the hud (Vermeulen)
3 change darkplaces renderer: change q3 shader system to use fingerprinting of shader passes to identify what kind of shader it is (for example "OPAQUE reflection ALPHA texture MODULATE $lightmap" metal shaders, and "OPAQUE texture1 ALPHA texture2 MODULATE $lightmap" terrain blending shaders), this would allow any identifiable q3 shader to have per pixel lighting, with full rendering capability
3 change darkplaces renderer: change texture manager to use a flat array with sequence purging on level change after stale models are unloaded, sequence marking and a flat array would allow reuse of textures by multiple models, multiple skins within a model, or even multiple texinfo structures in q3bsp
3 change darkplaces renderer: load q3 shader information at level load, and allow all models to use them
3 change darkplaces sound/render: change r_refdef calculations to happen before CL_UpdateScreen, and then move S_Update before CL_UpdateScreen to slightly improve sound latency issues, and then eliminate sound_spatialized variable

3 feature darkplaces docs: write a documentation string in engine, and a command to dump documentation to a darkplaces.txt file (QorpsE)
3 feature darkplaces editlights: add a custom light style string to rtlights, if empty it uses a normal server controlled light style (Stribbs)
3 feature darkplaces filesystem: add fs_reload command to allow restarting the filesystem module, this would mean that it could check for new paks and such (Mercury)
3 feature darkplaces loader: add _color.tga support (realtime lighting would use this instead of the .tga for diffuse layer if available) (Urre)
3 feature darkplaces loader: load .skin files for bsp files to allow per-map texture overrides (Spike)

3 feature darkplaces physics: DP_SV_TRACEMOVE extension, adds a qc builtin which traces an entity through the world (using origin/angles/mins/maxs/velocity/avelocity) for a specified amount of time (frametime typically), and sets trace results accordingly, this would greatly help out QC physics (Urre)
3 feature darkplaces physics: add DP_SV_CRATEPHYSICS (NotoriousRay)
3 feature darkplaces protocol: .string drawtext; displays the specified message (up to 31 characters) centered at the origin of this entity, for qc based menus and titles on things inside the world, also .float drawtextscale which defines character height and .float drawtextflags with DRAWTEXTFLAG_ORIENTED DRAWTEXTFLAG_UPRIGHTFACING DRAWTEXTFLAG_ALIGNTOP DRAWTEXTFLAG_ALIGNBOTTOM DRAWTEXTFLAG_ALIGNLEFT DRAWTEXTFLAG_ALIGNRIGHT, defaults to view parallel (like typical sprites) and centered alignment horizontally and vertically, also note colormod, and the effects flags EF_ADDITIVE EF_FULLBRIGHT (it is lit by default) EF_NODEPTHTEST EF_SELECTABLE apply to this (Wazat)
3 feature darkplaces protocol: add "GetPK3URLList" and "PK3URLListResponse" messages to allow a client to query a server for what pk3 archives to httpdownload before joining (Paul Gagnon)
3 feature darkplaces protocol: add DP_ENT_COLORSHELL which puts a Q2-style colored shell on a model (Supajoe)

3 feature darkplaces renderer: add Draw2D function to model struct to make it easy to draw models without an entity (Tomaz)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: add a command to replace a texture in the running map, should only work in singleplayer; for testing only (Randi)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: add antialiasing options (Zombie_13)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: add support for Color Code 3D anaglyph stereo glasses which are purple-blue/amber, this would require rendering the two views to a texture and then blending them with color modulation, some research will be needed to find out the specific colors to use, which should probably be cvar controlled (Francis Siefken)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: create collision brushes from q1bsp clip hulls, and make them display when using r_drawcollisionbrushes (Aardappel)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: directional lighting from the q3bsp lightgrid should use diffuse and specular lighting if available (Vermeulen)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: dpshaders (when supported) should have support for envmaps, and should support being lit by diffuse lighting as a fake gloss effect for normal mode (Vermeulen)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: implement steep parallax mapping with self shadowing and depth options: http://graphics.cs.brown.edu/games/SteepParallax/ (Kazashi, Randy)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: need to make a standalone minimod to test darkplaces rtlights code, which Diablo-D3 can throw at the ATI driver team to test with, 3D txtures with GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE wrapping are broken (Diablo-D3)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: skyroom needs to be added ("info_skyroom" entity sets view origin, scanned by client at load, and by server to send all entities in skyroom)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: try to achieve perfect transparency sorting by encoding them as a BSP tree to cause all to be split by eachothers' planes, or at least try recursively splitting each one by all of the previous accepted transparent polygons, the BSP encode method is still probably too slow to use but is worth trying, and the other method is even slower (Kazashi)
3 feature darkplaces renderer: try two-cubemap approach to specular lighting math on GF3 path (Black)
3 feature darkplaces sdl: make and submit a patch to add vsync control to libSDL
3 feature darkplaces server: add DP_GFX_QUAKE3MODELTAGS, DP_GFX_SKINFILES, and any other new extensions to the wiki (wiki)

3 feature darkplaces server: hub save support, one file indicating active map, and then for each map it saves a quake savegame
3 feature darkplaces server: make an event message queue for each client, so TE_ effects and sounds and can be stuffed into successive packets if they don't all fit at once, currently a large number of explosions at once are never sent because they don't fit in one size limited packet (romi)
3 feature darkplaces sound: add snd_rate cvar and make it changable during game (RenegadeC)
3 feature darkplaces sound: sound shaders; mindistance, maxdistance, list of sounds to choose from (Supa)
3 feature dpmod: code a func_swinging entity which takes a starting angle and swing time and swings back and forth, each time reaching that angle, and swinging through '0 0 0' (Zombie)

3 feature hmap2: add tga support to qbsp (load base texture and _glow/_luma)
3 feature nexuiz qc: add clanring-style menus and match settings
3 optimization darkplaces client: make a new caching system with handles (which can be purged) and give every entity a cache handle to a model instance, which contains cache handles for each mesh/array
3 optimization darkplaces renderer: implement some sort of areaportals system to let doors shut off portals, this needs to clip the portals by all bmodels in the area because in e1m1 the doors are two part and can't hide the portal individually (Vic)
3 optimization darkplaces renderer: use zpass (without front/back caps) shadowing for a speed gain if entity box is outside a frustum made from the light to the view's nearclip polygon edges, which determines whether the shadow would be casting directly onto the view surface (Tomaz)
3 optimization darkplaces server: make SV_ClipMoveToWorld cache trace results somehow for a speed gain in masque.bsp
4 bug darkplaces client: figure out why intermission camera pitch changes after a moment (Tomaz)
4 bug darkplaces networking: use getaddrinfo to support ipv6, add support for winsock2 (or require it), check if winsock2 has ipv6 functions (getaddrinfo)... (|Rain|)
4 bug darkplaces physics: rotating MOVETYPE_PUSH code calls blocked when it's just a touch, it isn't even trying to push
4 cleanup darkplaces memory: use the memory pool nesting feature ! (Black[,Vicious])
4 feature darkplaces client: add decals on models (Urre)
4 feature darkplaces client: proquake secure protocol support for playing on proquake servers (sublim3)
4 feature darkplaces console: add setlock command which marks a cvar as locked, and sends it over network to connected clients as a setlock command, the clients will not allow the user to modify the cvars while locked (and will only accept setlock commands over the network), and cvars are unlocked when level ends - the server will send the locks again on next level (VorteX)
4 feature darkplaces csqc: add builtin to clientside qc for reading triangles of model meshes (useful to orient a ui along a triangle of a model mesh)
4 feature darkplaces demo: ability to record demos while already connected (green)
4 feature darkplaces loader: add SKM model support (Vermeulen, Vic)
4 feature darkplaces loader: load .map file if present to get collision brushes for q1bsp (Transfusion)
4 feature darkplaces protocol: add capability for qc entities to act as bones in a model, and send them as compressed origins in the parent entity's updates, with perhaps a limit of 16 bones, this would allow some simple serverside ragdoll (Mitchell, Deej)
4 feature darkplaces protocol: multianimation support using multiple .frame fields on the entities for model formats with multianim capability such as SKM (Vermeulen)
4 feature darkplaces renderer: add _reflect textures which filter use of skybox as a cubemap reflection (FrikaC)
4 feature darkplaces rtlights: add a directional flag which makes the light cast along X only, rather than spherically, angles can be used to make it point at things, this will also affect shadow volumes, so portal clipping enhancements are needed, and non-uniform scaling is needed (Zombie)
4 feature darkplaces server: add DP_QC_MODELINFO extension to allow QC to ask about the range of frames owned by an animation base name, and other things like how many skins it has (Vermeulen, Supajoe)
4 feature darkplaces sound: rewrite sound system! (FrikaC, Static_Fiend)
4 feature dpzoo.map: a drivable vehicle (using same technique as remote cameras, plus DP_SV_READCLIENTINPUT)
4 feature hmap2: add hint brushes (HINT texture)
4 optimization darkplaces renderer: add cubemap light filter texture culling based on how much of the cubemap is used somehow (Vermeulen)
5 feature darkplaces client: add a "edictedit" command to open up a dialog to edit an edict (allow multiple dialogs to be open at once)
5 feature darkplaces client: add qc debugger, which would have its own very simple fullscreen console, this would be called directly from the qc interpreter, not from client (painQuin)
5 feature darkplaces console: r_textutf8 cvar (to parse UTF-8 codes), should affect all text rendering, using multiple conchar images for different groups of 256 characters (VorteX)
5 feature darkplaces renderer: add dpshader support
5 feature darkplaces renderer: add some kind of sun flare support, possibly stored in a dpshader (CheapAlert)
5 feature darkplaces renderer: do a minimap that works by simply using nearclip to sheer off anything above the eye, and draws anything below normally, or via a cvar as height coloring (Supajoe)
5 feature darkplaces renderer: implement transparent triangle sorting within each entity (FrikaC)
5 feature darkplaces renderer: lightshader files (probably loaded by the cubemap field already present in rtlights handling), these would indicate what attenuation textures to use for the light, what cubemap filter, which corona texture and size and so on, and all textures can be animated (romi, Urre)
5 feature darkplaces server: split server into a separate thread when running listen mode so that a host running too slow won't spoil the game (Toddd)
5 feature dpzoo.map: make some things that make the player bigger/smaller to demonstrate scaling and better viewheight handling and brush collisions (depends on brush collisions)
5 feature hmap2: fix tjunctions on leaky maps
6 feature darkplaces client: add a "edit" command that can edit text files (I.E. .qc and progs.src) using a dialog window (allow multiple), and then add a "frikqcc" command to run it on the current mod (if it's in the command path at least)
6 feature darkplaces renderer: figure out an LOD scheme for really large outdoor environments (Uffe)
7 feature darkplaces protocol,renderer: add DP_EF_REFRACT which turns an entity into a refraction effect similar to doom3 shockwave/heathaze (Supajoe)

7 feature darkplaces renderer: mirrors
7 feature darkplaces renderer: shadow volume clipping (romi)

d bug darkplaces WGL client: fix GDI input init/shutdown, it is using weird mouse acceleration and not restoring it on exit (innovati)
d bug darkplaces X11 keyboard: make sure that the XLookupString code is not little endian specific (Elric, jitspoe)

d bug darkplaces client sbar: when playing demos recorded from singleplayer, the deathmatch hud seems to be used, perhaps we have to force it off for maxplayers 1? (Spirit)
d bug darkplaces client win64: crash in R_DrawRTLight due to stack overflow, change the pointer arrays to indexes into r_refdef.scene.entities, or increase projects to build with 4MB stack instead of 2MB - also clean up these warnings: http://dp.deathmask.net/log/dp_x64_buildlog_r8078.txt (Willis)

d bug darkplaces client: crosshair_static 0 breaks if self is EF_NODRAW (NecroPhil)
d bug darkplaces client: disable vsync when doing a timedemo (Randy)
d bug darkplaces client: do replay cl_movement queue each time a move is added, as this is called from the server packet parser, which can overwhelm the client with several packets in one frame, leading to a complete lockup until the level changes (Black)
d bug darkplaces client: figure out why multimap demos are skipping the later portions, it's probably related to the time seeking, probably not being reset (Urre)
d bug darkplaces client: finale text during episode-end intermissions shows briefly in its entirety and all as one line (going off the screen), then disappears and begins typing slowly as it should (Sajt)
d bug darkplaces client: fix cl_bobmodel bug which momentarily jolts the gun when you pass through a trigger, pick up an item, etc, Sajt thinks this is related to console prints as well as centerprint (Sajt)
d bug darkplaces client: fix gl_flashblend, it's still drawing rtdlights even when gl_flashblend is on (Toddd)
d bug darkplaces client: hipnotic: health is one character to the right on the sbar, covering up the key icons (M`Shacron)

d bug darkplaces client: make server queries use a queue to avoid flooding out queries too fast (Willis)
d bug darkplaces client: missing bolt/beam models should not produce warnings
d bug darkplaces client: name (and probably other userinfo properties) are not being set when entering a qw server?
d bug darkplaces client: on crctf proquake servers the scoreboard does not contain exactly matching player names (READY is sometimes appended), the ping report and status parsing should ignore text after the player name
d bug darkplaces client: prydon cursor highlighting of EF_SELECTABLE entities flickers with lower server framerate than client framerate (carni)
d bug darkplaces client: quakeworld servers often stuffcmd the cvars topcolor, bottomcolor, pants, team, skin, noaim, so commands for these need to be added (topcolor/bottomcolor will modify _cl_color, the others can be real cvars)
d bug darkplaces client: seta commands create cvars that are not saved to config because they match their 'default' value
d bug darkplaces client: svc_effect should post a warning and do nothing if given a framerate below 1 (Willis)
d bug darkplaces client: te_customflash isn't working? (Wazat)
d bug darkplaces client: userinfo strings are not being updated by name/color commands
d bug darkplaces client: when playing back a demo in slow motion it is very noticable that the camera rotates into position on the first frame (Stribbs)

d bug darkplaces commands: say command is not posting to server console (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces compatibility: targetquake does not work, figure out why
d bug darkplaces console: $* expansion should not include $0 (Black)
d bug darkplaces console: $variable expansion is not working on forwarded commands like "say I'm $_cl_name", it does work on local commands like set (esteel, Black)
d bug darkplaces console: alias test "echo 1";test;echo 2 should print 1 then 2, not 2 then 1 or an error (div0, FrikaC)
d bug darkplaces console: chat messages are showing up in brown quake characters and having ^7 and such printed literally
d bug darkplaces console: commandline history won't scroll back past a blank line - the blank line should not be entered into history (Elric)
d bug darkplaces console: console script lines that are too long (1024+ characters) crash (NecroPhil, Black)
d bug darkplaces console: don't save cvars to config.cfg if their current value matches their default value (div0)
d bug darkplaces console: first character is missing on quake brown-text lines, but not consistently, resolved: stripping off the chat prefix character on prints was stripping other characters sometimes due to signed comparison (Spirit)
d bug darkplaces console: inserting characters in the commandline is not adding a nul terminator to the commandline, resulting in lots of trash from older commandlines suddenly showing up (Spike)
d bug darkplaces console: make map listing read the .ent files for map names
d bug darkplaces console: rapid printing (like cvarlist) is somehow being truncated when printing to the terminal (div0)
d bug darkplaces console: when cursoring up and down through command history, shorter lines sometimes contain some text from the previous line
d bug darkplaces csqc: after the drawqueue was eliminated, the CSQC probably can't draw 2D polygons the same way, so it may need fixing ([515])
d bug darkplaces csqc: engine-based rocket entities have a trail but they don't glow if csqc is used
d bug darkplaces csqc: implement lerpfrac/frame2 fields (Spike)
d bug darkplaces csqc: it's broken!
d bug darkplaces csqc: network entity positions seem to be incorrectly updated while csqc is active, this is best tested with cl_nolerp 1 on a sys_ticrate 0.1 server, which makes the jumps in rocket movement quite noticable
d bug darkplaces csqc: when playing back a demo, the csqc does not seem to be getting the cl.viewangles right
d bug darkplaces docs: host_maxfps is gone, correct the darkplaces.txt and host.c cvar description for host_framerate
d bug darkplaces general: make all text parsing routines support Mac newlines; \r with no \n (Zenex)
d bug darkplaces gl: turning r_shadow_bouncegrid off and back on left a messed up texture binding state

d bug darkplaces init: only print "Playing shareware version." notice if running GAME_QUAKE (MrBIOS)
d bug darkplaces input: buttons 4 and 5 on a mouse are acting like mwheel (Kedhrin)
d bug darkplaces input: centerview command isn't doing anything until console is activated, it should begin the pitch drift immediately as in quake (Sajt)
d bug darkplaces input: figure out what's wrong with ctrl key in Linux, hitting character keys tends to do nothing, and holding a character key and then hitting ctrl tends to leave the character key stuck on, this sounds like a window manager issue, but somehow quake3 works around it (Baalz)
d bug darkplaces input: fix the mouse move when console is raised in glx, probably by ignoring the first move after console raise (mashakos)
d bug darkplaces input: ignore first mouse move in windows fullscreen when coming back from an alt-tab (sublim3)
d bug darkplaces loader: AliasSkinFiles stuff is crashing because of the changed skin indexing, it needs to step in multiples of num_surfaces not 1 (Willis)
d bug darkplaces loader: fix hlbsp transparent surface support (mrinsane)
d bug darkplaces loader: halflife wad loading is unable to seek to lump table (ryan[sg], Elric)
d bug darkplaces loader: nexuiz loading a level often loops part of the map's music during loading, this is probably an extra Host_Frame being executed during loading, where it shouldn't be (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces loader: only load .lit if the file size matches lumpsize * 3 + 8, as a rough check that the lit is for the correct bsp file (Spike, Urre)
d bug darkplaces loader: q3bsp deluxemap detection can fail on some files, thinking they have deluxemaps even though they don't? (jimmmy)
d bug darkplaces loader: q3bsp lightgrid loading seems to be ignoring the "gridsize" key of worldspawn, but how?
d bug darkplaces loader: unlit q1bsp maps are showing as black rather than fullbright... again.
d bug darkplaces loader: zym models are not loading some of their meshes?  this is causing the striped part of the nexuiz RL to disappear (div0, SavageX)
d bug darkplaces loading: test zlib support with entirely pk3'd id1 data (should crash because of zlib not being setup early enough - fix this) (Mabus)
d bug darkplaces loading: when gamedir (or -game) contains a directory which listdirectory() fails on, do a Host_Error with an appropriate message, rather than running with a non-existent directory
d bug darkplaces makefile: build nexuiz.exe using nexuiz.rc (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces menu: if no data is found, the menu should be text
d bug darkplaces menu: if no data is found, there are only 3 menu options selectable, even though that is not enough to be able to select quit...  perhaps some nexuiz-specific logic is malfunctioning?
d bug darkplaces menu: load/save game menus show files that are not in the highest priority gamedir, such as id1 saves showing up when playing dpmod (Dooomer, WodahsEht)
d bug darkplaces menuvm: menu input focus is lost if a map command occurs while in menu, even if it fails the menu still lost focus and is unusable until closed and reopened with escape key (Black, Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces model: don't Host_Error when a model is unknown/unsupported type (SavageX, Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces model: ignore attempts to load "" (SavageX, Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces particles: cl_particles_quality is affecting lifetime of decals, it should not
d bug darkplaces physics: corpses/gibs are not riding down e1m1 lift (scar3crow)
d bug darkplaces physics: in Prydon Gate the func_door2 entities are stuck in eachother, causing a continuous spew of warnings and causing one of them to be teleported slightly upward which looks bad (FrikaC)
d bug darkplaces physics: q3bsp collisions are still glitchy, particularly gunshots hitting thin air near brushes, even with mod_q3bsp_optimizedtraceline 0, test in dpdm2r by shooting down through gaps in the architecture around the top platform (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces physics: test TecnoX and find the frikbot crash in SV_Physics (KrimZon)
d bug darkplaces physics: the zombie lift in e3m2 before the gold key is not working (scar3crow)
d bug darkplaces physics: when riding a lift down (such as near the start of e1m1), the player is not being pulled down, unlike in quake, this can cause repeated fall damage on very fast lifts (scar3crow)
d bug darkplaces protocol: fix cl_nodelta 1, it's halting updates after you move away from an area (Tomaz, sublim3)
d bug darkplaces protocol: fix signon error when starting prydon without +map curig2 (FrikaC)
d bug darkplaces protocol: getting packetlog overflow warnings again, but WHY? (daemon, SavageX)
d bug darkplaces protocol: it's possible to get a "received signon 1 when at 1" error in singleplayer when restarting level, perhaps this relates to very low framerate
d bug darkplaces protocol: models sometimes staying in nexuiz after a big battle, entities that don't exist on the server anymore (Spike)
d bug darkplaces protocol: something is causing things like tracers to sometimes stay indefinitely (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces protocol: sometimes players are invisible in nexuiz, showing only their gun model, this may be related to svc_precache messages not being sent during signon (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces prvm: VM_remove does not print a stack trace (RenegadeC)
d bug darkplaces prvm: all warnings should print a stack trace (RenegadeC)
d bug darkplaces prvm: assignment to world is not producing an error after world spawn stage (Spike)
d bug darkplaces prvm: engine calls to qc functions are not counting as function calls in the prvm_profile results, so for example SV_PlayerPhysics is being shown with a 0 call count
d bug darkplaces prvm: findchain/findchainfloat are corrupting things when trying to write to the .chain field (Kedhrin)
d bug darkplaces prvm: findflags/findchainflags are server-specific, these should be moved into the generic progs commands
d bug darkplaces prvm: the merged remove is causing a Host_Error on already removed entities, which happens in id1 start.bsp (RenegadeC)
d bug darkplaces prvm: unknown opcode warnings are missing a \n
d bug darkplaces qc FRIK_FILE: when opening a file for writing that already has the data/ prefix in its path, it should not add another data/ prefix (daemon)
d bug darkplaces qc: document the wasfreed() builtin from EXT_CSQC and entitybyindex() builtins, the latter is DP_QC_EDICT_NUM (Urre)
d bug darkplaces quakec: to stop crashing on 64bit the quakec vm needs a string manager that can allocate/free negative integer indices to the strzone strings, and also automatically add engine strings
d bug darkplaces readme: commandline options are slightly out of date, update them (Baker)
d bug darkplaces renderer/server: scaled sprites (or possibly all models) are getting culled as if they were not scaled (KrimZon)
d bug darkplaces renderer: Morphed's colormapping experiments in nexuiz show a difference in gloss color with GLSL vs dot3 path, http://img494.imageshack.us/img494/8745/nexuiz0000258lf.jpg http://www.nexuiz.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1531 - and apparently it looks right or wrong depending on view point, suddenly switching (Morphed)
d bug darkplaces renderer: add r_shadow_glsl_geforcefxlowquality cvar to make make GLSL shaders use "half" data type, automatically set this if on GFFX (MauveBib, SavageX)
d bug darkplaces renderer: alternate anims are not showing up in wall renderer - they are working for rtlights however (LordHavoc)
d bug darkplaces renderer: animated textures are not being lit by static rtlights
d bug darkplaces renderer: audit all text drawing to make color codes work properly everywhere, right now they are even managing to mess up death message printing if someone has a color code in their name (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces renderer: audit rtlight ambient rendering, apparently scissor is clipping away parts of lights that have ambientscale but not ones that have diffusescale or specularscale (Zenex)
d bug darkplaces renderer: colormap rendering not working on rtlighting passes, resulting in black pants/shirt
d bug darkplaces renderer: colormod is not affecting bmodels (Urre)
d bug darkplaces renderer: compiled rtlights aren't working in modeltest.bsp which is a one cluster map (LordHavoc)
d bug darkplaces renderer: deluxemaps are not detected in some maps that do have them?  (SavageX)
d bug darkplaces renderer: don't shut off gl_combine when r_textureunits goes below 2, and don't save gl_combine either
d bug darkplaces renderer: entity culling is ignoring entity scale (daemon)
d bug darkplaces renderer: envmap command includes the hud in the screenshots, bad!
d bug darkplaces renderer: fix fogging in realtime lighting mode, need to split the shaders into two stages, this will also fix decal bugs with fog (Mitchell)
d bug darkplaces renderer: fix q3bsp fogging (Sajt)
d bug darkplaces renderer: fix rtlighting of viewmodel, it should not be performing lighting on a model outside the light radius (LordHavoc)
d bug darkplaces renderer: fix the delayed lightmap updates on bmodels, they're lagging behind one frame, very noticable on flickering light
d bug darkplaces renderer: fix vis problems when outside the level in q1bsp
d bug darkplaces renderer: gl_max_size is affecting bloom (causing a black screen when gl_max_size is less than the screen dimensions) (Willis)
d bug darkplaces renderer: glsl lighting path is not using GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE
d bug darkplaces renderer: if a texture has the NOLIGHTMAP flag set, disable deluxemapping on the batch, this is needed to fix the glowing stuff in nexuiz maps like the stairs in Glow Arena or the slime pipes in Slime Pit (SavageX)
d bug darkplaces renderer: in full rtlighting mode, deluxemapping gloss still shows up (the diffuse and ambient does not)
d bug darkplaces renderer: make rtlights properly affect transparent models (romi)
d bug darkplaces renderer: make sure that unlit maps show up fullbright (Wazat)
d bug darkplaces renderer: monsters teleporting in really slow down rendering, perhaps the teleport light is casting huge shadows?  new information suggests it is the particles. (romi, lcatlnx)
d bug darkplaces renderer: opaque water (r_wateralpha 1) is not being lit by rtlights (Sajt)
d bug darkplaces renderer: q3bsp alpha shaders are not being lit?  (Cheapy)

d bug darkplaces renderer: r_drawcollisionbrushes 2 is broken (LordHavoc)
d bug darkplaces renderer: r_glsl 1 mode has black grapple beam in nexuiz (SavageX)
d bug darkplaces renderer: r_wateralpha 0.9 is invisible on r_glsl 0;gl_combine 0 path (Lardarse]
d bug darkplaces renderer: r_wateralpha 1 water that has lightmapping is black in r_shadow_realtime_world 1 mode, but only if the map was loaded in r_shadow_realtime_world 1 mode, if started in 0 and then going to 1 it does not have black water, this is probably lightmap updates not occurring in rtworld mode (mrinsane)
d bug darkplaces renderer: r_wateralpha on maps that are not watervised shows sky, this is a known glquake bug but it is fixable in darkplaces at load time by marking opposite-content (water-empty, empty-water) leafs as visible in their pvs sets, this involves checking the portal flow...  (knghtbrd)
d bug darkplaces renderer: reverse corona traceline direction so that a player in solid can see coronas (Urre)
d bug darkplaces renderer: shadow volumes from q3bsp brush models are broken, maybe inverted or something (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces renderer: text coloring is only affecting the first line of messagemode text (LordHavoc)
d bug darkplaces renderer: there's some sort of bug with GL_CullFace, it is sometimes rendering the map using GL_CullFace(GL_NONE) depending on viewpoint

d bug darkplaces renderer: transparent surfaces are not being lit by rtlights (Vermeulen)
d bug darkplaces renderer: vertex normals seem to be generated backwards
d bug darkplaces renderer: vid_restart and r_restart are both crashing (Tomaz)
d bug darkplaces rtlights: light entity import should spawn lights at torch origin so that it does not cast a shadow
d bug darkplaces sdl client: gamma is being lost after a vid_restart
d bug darkplaces server: .colormap is not being set on DP_SV_BOTCLIENT entities the first time, but if removed and spawned again it is set (Urre)
d bug darkplaces server: Blood Mage monsters are stuck in place apparently (steven a)

d bug darkplaces server: call checkvelocity (to clear NaNs) every time velocity is set in physics, to fix frikbot (tell FrikaC)
d bug darkplaces server: cl_movement 0 clients can pogostick jump and do quake2 style double jumps... why?  answer: id1 qc move was clearing self.button2 each time it jumped, which causes it to pogostick when client input rate is lower than server framerate, fixed. (div)
d bug darkplaces server: client ping times are often negative after a level change, which shows up in the console on the client because the ping report parser doesn't like negative pings
d bug darkplaces server: don't clear player entity when loading a savegame
d bug darkplaces server: dropclient() is not calling ClientDisconnect on bots during the first level they exist in, it is called on later levels (Urre)

f darkplaces testing: figure out a workaround for broken gcc optimizers on BoxOnPlaneSide? (Diablo-D3)
f darkplaces video: detect 5x4 video aspect ratio modes (such as 1280x1024) and set a 0.9375 pixel aspect (which is (1280/1024)/(1280/960)) when these modes are active?
f darkplaces: add DP_EF_PRECISEANGLES extension (sends short angles instead of byte), failed because network protocol was upgraded by default (Wazat for Battlemech, FrikaC, mashakos, RenegadeC, Sajt)
f darkplaces: add _0.tga support (per texture) to bsp/md2/md3 loaders
f darkplaces: add a loading screen (gfx/loadback.tga or the loading plaque if that's not found) before loading commences so that people have something to look at when the engine starts... (Sajt)
f darkplaces: add a new TE_TELEPORTSHELL effect which would take an entity and create a fading plasma shell of its model at the moment of teleportation (tell fuh and Mercury about this)

f darkplaces: fix colormapping (Demonix)
f darkplaces: fix connecting to proquake servers through routers (Demonix)
f darkplaces: fix sound resampling to not assume sound ends with value 0, and add support for passing in start and end times, as doubles, so that it can handle arbitrary mixing alignments

f feature darkplaces renderer: add cubemap reflections like UT2003 somehow (perhaps entities would define the reflection maps for rooms, and a water entity would take care of the rest?)
f feature darkplaces server: add an extension to check if a file exists outside the data directory, FRIK_FILE can do this but only inside data directory (Error)
f feature dpmod: include .lit and .dlit files for all id1 maps - this idea was rejected due to download size
f feature dpmod: include .vis files for all id1 maps - this idea rejected due to lack of .vis support and download size

f optimization darkplaces renderer: change water distortion textures from multiple 2D textures to one 3D texture for smoother animation (Tomaz)
f optimization darkplaces visibility: R_Q3BSP_RecursiveWorldNode should take clipflags parameter and do not cull a node against a plane if the parent node is totally on one side of the plane (Vic)
