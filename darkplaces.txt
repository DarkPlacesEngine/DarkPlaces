DarkPlaces engine readme : updated 20070311:

About the DarkPlaces glquake engine:
DarkPlaces engine was started because I was unsatisfied with the other engines available soon after the quake source release (which did little more than add some flashy effects), and craved modding features for my DarkPlaces mod, and wanted some real enhancements to the online gaming experience as well.

DarkPlaces engine is the result, I hope everyone likes it.

I am not very good at writing documentation, so this readme is organized as a feature list, with information on each feature, I hope it is still adequate documentation.

If you have any suggestions for features to document in detail in the readme or any other questions/comments/bugreports/suggestions/etc, send me an email with the address lordhavoc ghdigital com (add @ and . characters as appropriate)




Input Tips:
If mouse movement is jerky but framerate is high, try typing "gl_finish 1" (without quotes) into the console (makes cpu wait for gpu before ending frame, which gives lousy input drivers a chance to catch up).



Graphics Tips:
Visit the Color Control submenu of Options, it's near the top, fiddle with gamma (or grey level if using the color levels mode) until the grey box surrounding the white/black dither pattern matches up with the grey you see while looking at the dither from a distance, this will calibrate quake to look approximately as id Software intended, and ensure everyone sees it the same. Note: Different resolutions may be different intensities depending on monitor. Note2: ATI Radeon Catalyst 3.10 drivers seem to have a weird gamma limiting 'feature' which rejects gamma settings it doesn't like, feel free to complain to ATI about this if it gets in your way (it probably will).

Visit the Effects Options submenu of Options, and check out the options.



Networking tips:
Visit the Player Setup submenu of the Multiplayer menu to configure your network speed (as well as the usual settings from quake like name and colors).

To host a server behind a router/firewall, simply set up a port forward on the UDP port you are running the server on (default is 26000), to forward incoming UDP packets on that port to the server, then people can connect.

To make your server show up on the server browser (in the Join Game menu), either set sv_public 1 in the console, or use the multiplayer new game menu and check the Public server checkbox.

Graphics features:
Redesigned effects including smoke, blood, bubbles and explosions.
Better looking dynamic lights.
External texture support (see Replacement Content section below)
Realtime bumpmapped lighting/shadowing support (r_shadow_realtime_world cvar) with many options.  (note: very slow if you do not have .rtlights files installed, be sure to get some from dpmod or search on the web for rtlights files)
.rtlights file support (improves performance/appearance of realtime lighting)
.rtlights file editing (see r_editlights_help in game)
Alpha blended sprites (instead of glquake's masked sprites).
Interpolated entity movement and animations (both models and sprites).
Overbright and fullbright support on walls and models (like winquake).
Colormapping support on any q1 model (like winquake).
Fog (set with "fog density red green blue" command)
Skybox (loadsky "mtnsun_" will load "env/mtnsun_ft.tga" and so on).
Sky rendering improved (no more glquake distortion).
Sky polygons obscure geometry just like in winquake.
Color calibration menu to ensure a proper Quake experience.
Improved model lighting (directional shading).
No messy .ms2 model mesh files (no glquake dir anymore either).
New improved crosshair (team color coded).
Improved image loading (smoother menus and such).
Ability to disable particle effects (cl_particles* cvars).
Decals (cl_decals cvar to enable).
Stainmaps (cl_stainmap cvar to enable).
Sorted transparent stuff to render better.
Improved multitexture support (r_textureunits (1-4 supported), needs gl_combine 1 because of overbright)
Improved chase cam (chase_active 1 no longer goes into walls)
More configurable console background (scr_conalpha and scr_conbrightness)
Optional fullbrights (r_fullbrights 0/1 followed by r_restart)
Dynamic Farclip (no distance limits in huge maps)
Improved gl_flashblend (now renders a corona instead of an ugly blob)
DynamicLight coronas (more realism)
Transparent statusbar (sbar_alpha) that does not block your view as much.
No 8bit texture uploads (fixes 'green' walls in the distance).
Fixed view blends (glquake was quite broken).
JPEG texture support using libjpeg (Thanks Elric)
Video Options, Color Control, and Effects Options menus added, and more options.
.dlit file support (produced by hmap2 -light) for fast per-pixel lighting without shadowing.
pointfile command is improved (for leak finding in maps when you have a .pnt file from a failed qbsp compile)
configurable particle effects (effectinfo.txt, can be reloaded at any time by cl_particles_reloadeffects command for quick testing)
fixed envmap command (makes a skybox of the current scene)



Sound features:
Ogg and wav file overrides for cd tracks (example: sound/cdtracks/track01.ogg or .wav) (Thanks Elric)
Streaming ogg sounds to save memory (Ogg sounds over a certain size are streamed automatically) (Thanks Elric)
Ogg Vorbis sound support (all .wav sounds look for .ogg if the .wav is missing, useful for making mods smaller, particularly useful for cd tracks) (Thanks Elric)
Stereo sound file support (useful for cd tracks)
7.1 surround sound mixing support (snd_channels cvar selects how many to use, default 2 for stereo)



Client features:
showtime cvar.
showdate cvar.
-benchmark option to run automated timedemo benchmarks (-benchmark demo1 does +timedemo demo1 and quits immediately when finished)
timedemo automatically puts results in gamedir/benchmark.log
Slightly improved aiming on quake servers (does not support proquake aiming).
-sndspeed samplerate (default: 44100, quake used 11025)
snd_swapstereo cvar (for people with backwards SB16 sound cards)
Saves video settings to config and restores them properly
Ability to change video settings during game (video options menu or vid_* cvars)
showfps cvar.
Sends 20fps network packets to improve modem play instead of one per frame. (sys_ticrate controls network framerate)
Allow skin colormaps 14 and 15 (freaky :)
Longer chat messages.
No more 72fps limit, cl_maxfps lets you decide.
Support for more mouse buttons (mouse1-mouse16, mwheelup/mwheeldown are aliases to mouse4 and mouse5).
Server browser for public (sv_public 1) darkplaces servers as well as quakeworld servers.
log_file cvar to log console messages to a file.
condump command to dump recent console history to a file.
PK3 archive support with compression support using zlib (Thanks Elric)
maps command lists installed maps
tab completion of map names on map/changelevel commands
tab completion of rcon commands
.ent file replacement allows you to modify sky and fog settings on a per-map basis (use sv_saveentfile command in singleplayer and then edit the worldspawn entity in a text editor, for example setting "sky" "mtnsun_" to load the skybox mtnsun_ in your favorite maps, or "fog" "0.03 0.2 0.2 0.2" to put fog in the level)
Switchable bindmaps (in_bind command allows you to bind keys in one of 8 bindmaps, 0-7, in_bindmap command allows you to select two active bindmaps to use at once, ones missing in the first are checked in the second)
Options menu "Reset to Defaults" option works better than in Quake
cvarlist and cmdlist commands
improved tab completion of commands and cvars, with default value and description listed
curl command (downloads a URL to a pk3 archive and loads it)
fs_rescan command (allows you to load a newly installed pak/pk3 archive without quitting the game)
saveconfig command (allows you to save settings before quitting the game, mostly useful when debugging the engine if you expect it to crash)
gamedir command to change current mod (only works while disconnected).
QuakeWorld support.
ProQuake message macros (%l location, %d last death location, %h health, %a armor, %x rockets, %c cells, %t current time, %r rocket launcher status (I need RL, I need rockets, I have RL), %p powerup status (quad pent ring), %w weapon status (SSG:NG:SNG:GL:RL:LG).
Support for ProQuake .loc files (locs/e1m1.loc or maps/e1m1.loc)
Support for QIZMO .loc files (maps/e1m1.loc)
Ingame editing of .loc files using locs_* commands (locs_save saves a new .loc file to maps directory)
bestweapon command (takes a number sequence like bestweapon 87654321, digits corresponding to weapons, first ones are preferred over last ones, only uses weapons that have 1 ammo or more)
ls and dir commands to list files in the Quake virtual filesystem (useful to find files inside paks)
toggle command allows you to use a single bind to toggle a cvar between 0 and 1
slowmo cvar allows you to pause/slow down/speed up demo playback (try using these binds for example: bind f1 "slowmo 0";bind f2 "slowmo 0.1";bind f3 "slowmo 1")
AVI video recording using builtin I420 codec (bind f4 "toggle cl_capturevideo"), with automatic creation of sequentially numbered avi files for each recording session.  (WARNING: HUGE files, make sure you have several gigabytes of disk space available!  and it is only recommended during demo playback!  You will probably want to reencode these videos using VirtualDub, mencoder, or other utilities before posting them on a website)
ping display in scoreboard, even on Quake servers (on DarkPlaces servers it also shows packet loss)



Server features:
Allows clients to connect through firewalls (automatic feature)
Works behind firewalls unlike NetQuake (must port forward UDP packets on the relevant port from the firewall to the server, as with any game)
More accurate movement and precise aiming.
255 player support.
sv_cheats cvar controls cheats (no longer based on deathmatch).
slowmo cvar controls game speed.
No crash with the buggy 'teleport train' in shub's pit.
Allow skin colormaps 14 and 15 (freaky :)
sys_ticrate applies to listen (client) servers as well as dedicated.
sv_public cvar to advertise to master server.
log_file cvar to log console messages to a file.
condump command to dump recent console history to a file.
PK3 archive support with compression support using zlib (Thanks Elric)
Option to prevent wallhacks from working (sv_cullentities_trace 1).
Selectable protocol (sv_protocolname QUAKE for example allows quake clients to play, default is sv_protocolname DP7 or a later protocol)
Automatic file downloads to DarkPlaces clients.
Ability to send URLs to DarkPlaces clients to download pk3 archives needed to play on this server.
rcon support for remote administration by trusted clients with matching rcon_password, or external quakeworld rcon tools
prvm_edictset, prvm_global, prvm_globals, and prvm_globalset commands aid in QuakeC debugging
prvm_printfunction function prints out the QuakeC assembly opcodes of a function, can be useful if you can't decompile the progs.dat file
prvm_profile command gives call count and estimated builtin-function cost
sys_colortranslation cvar controls processing of Quake3-style ^ color codes in terminal output, default is white text on windows and ANSI color output on Linux/Mac OSX
sys_specialcharactertranslation controls processing of special Quake characters to make colored names more readable in terminal output



Modding features:
HalfLife map support (place your HalfLife wads in quake/id1/textures/ or quake/MODDIR/textures/ as the maps need them)
Larger q1 and hl map size of +-32768 units.
Colored lighting (.lit support) for q1 maps.
Q3 map support (no shaders though), with no limits.
Q2 and Q3 model support, with greatly increased limits (256 skins, 65536 frames, 65536 vertices, 65536 triangles).  (Note: md2 player models are not supported because they have no skin list)
Optimized QuakeC interpreter so mods run faster.
Bounds checking QuakeC interpreter so mods can't do naughty things with memory.
Warnings for many common QuakeC errors.
Unprecached models are now a warning (does not kill the server anymore).
External texture support (see dpextensions.qc DP_GFX_EXTERNALTEXTURES).
Fog ("fog" key in worldspawn, same parameters as fog command).
.spr32 and halflife .spr sprites supported.  (Use Krimzon's tool to make spr32, and lhfire can render directly to spr32, or just use replacement textures on .spr).
Skybox ("sky" key in worldspawn, works like loadsky and quake2).
Stereo wav sounds supported.
Ogg Vorbis sounds supported. (Thanks Elric)
ATTN_NONE sounds are no longer directional (good for music).
play2 sound testing command (ATTN_NONE variant of play).
r_texturestats and memstats and memlist commands to give memory use info.
Lighting on sprites (put ! anywhere in sprite filename to enable).
More r_speeds info (now a transparent overlay instead of spewing to console).
Supports rotating bmodels (use avelocity, and keep in mind the bmodel needs the "origin" key set to rotate (read up on hipnotic rotation support in your qbsp docs, or choose another qbsp if yours does not support this feature), or in q3 maps an origin brush works).
More sound channels.
More dynamic lights (32 changed to 256).
More precached models and sounds (256 changed to 4096).
Many more features documented in dpextensions.qc. (bullet tracing on models, qc player input, etc)



Replacing Content:
Formats supported: tga (recommended), png (loads very slowly), jpg (loads slowly), pcx, wal, lmp

Usually you want to put replacement content in either id1/ or another directory such as pretty/ inside your quake directory, in DarkPlaces you can run multiple -game options at once (such as -game ctf -game pretty -game dpmod to have texture overrides from pretty, maps from ctf, and gameplay from dpmod) or multiple gamedirs specified with the gamedir console command (gamedir ctf pretty dpmod).

All texture layers are optional except diffuse (the others are NOT loaded without it)

Replacing skins:
progs/player.mdl_0.tga - diffuse
progs/player.mdl_0_norm.tga - normalmap (can have alpha channel with bumpmap height for offsetmapping/reliefmapping)
progs/player.mdl_0_bump.tga - bumpmap (not loaded if normalmap is present)
progs/player.mdl_0_glow.tga - glow map (use _luma if tenebrae compatibility is a concern)
progs/player.mdl_0_luma.tga - alternate tenebrae-compatible name for glow map (use one or the other)
progs/player.mdl_0_pants.tga - pants image, greyscale and does not cover the same pixels as the diffuse texture (this is additive blended ('Screen' mode in photoshop) ontop of the diffuse texture with a color tint according to your pants color)
progs/player.mdl_0_shirt.tga - shirt image, same type as pants

Replacing textures in specific maps:
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6.tga
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6_norm.tga
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6_bump.tga
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6_glow.tga
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6_luma.tga
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6_pants.tga - pants and shirt layers are possible on bmodel entities with quakec modifications to set their .colormap field
textures/e1m1/ecop1_6_shirt.tga

Replacing textures in all maps:
textures/quake.tga
textures/quake_norm.tga
textures/quake_bump.tga
textures/quake_glow.tga
textures/quake_luma.tga
textures/quake_pants.tga
textures/quake_shirt.tga

Replacing hud and menu pictures:
gfx/conchars.tga

Replacing models:
same as in Quake, you can replace a model with exactly the same file name (including file extension), so for example an md3 player model has to be renamed progs/player.mdl, and a small box of shells in md3 format has to be renamed maps/b_shell0.bsp

How to make .skin files for multiple skins on a Quake3 (md3) or DarkPlacesModel (dpm) model:
These files use the same format as the ones in Quake3 (except being named modelname_0.skin, modelname_1.skin, and so on), they specify what texture to use on each part of the md3 (or zym or dpm or psk) model, their contents look like the following...
torso,progs/player_default.tga                    says that the model part named "torso" should use the image progs/player_default.tga
gun,progs/player_default.tga                      says that the model part named "gun" should use the image progs/player_default.tga
muzzleflash,progs/player_default_muzzleflash.tga  says that the model part named "muzzleflash" should use the image progs/player_default_muzzleflash.tga - this is useful for transparent skin areas which should be kept separate from opaque skins
tag_head,                                         says that the first tag is named "tag_head" - this is only useful for QuakeC mods using segmented player models so that they can look up/down without their legs rotating, don't worry about it as a user
tag_torso,                                        second tag name
tag_weapon,                                       third tag name

Example list of filenames:
quake/id1/progs/player.mdl                        replaces the player model)
quake/id1/progs/player.mdl_0.skin                 text file that specifies textures to use on an md3 model)
quake/id1/progs/player_default.tga                texture referenced by the .skin, make sure that any special parts of this are black, like pants should be black here otherwise you get pink pants when you use a red color ingame)
quake/id1/progs/player_default_pants.tga          white pants area of the skin, this is colored by the engine according to your color settings, additive blended (which is called "Screen" mode in Photoshop if you wish to preview the layers))
quake/id1/progs/player_default_shirt.tga          white shirt area of the skin, similar to pants described above)
quake/id1/progs/player_default_norm.tga           normalmap texture for player_default, alpha channel can contain a heightmap for offsetmapping (r_glsl_offsetmapping 1 in console) to use, alternatively you can use _bump.tga instead of this which is only a heightmap and the engine will generate the normalmap for you)
quake/id1/progs/player_default_gloss.tga          glossmap (shiny areas) for player_default)
quake/id1/progs/player_default_glow.tga           glowmap (glowing stuff) for player_default, this is fullbrights and such, be sure the corresponding pixels are black in the player_default.tga, because just like pants/shirt this is additive blended)
quake/id1/textures/quake.tga                      replaces the quake logo on the arch in start.bsp)
quake/id1/textures/quake_norm.tga                 same as for a player)
quake/id1/textures/quake_gloss.tga                same as for a player)
quake/id1/textures/#water1.tga                    replaces *water1 texture in the maps, # is used instead of * in filenames)
quake/id1/gfx/conchars.tga                        replacement font image, this was in gfx.wad in quake)
quake/id1/gfx/conback.tga                         replacement console background, just like in quake)
quake/id1/gfx/mainmenu.tga                        replacement main menu image, just like in quake)
quake/id1/maps/b_bh25.bsp                         replacement for normal health pack, for example this could be an md3 model instead)

How to install Quake on Windows:
All that DarkPlaces needs from the Quake CD is pak files (be sure not to copy opengl32.dll from the Quake CD, it will not work with DarkPlaces!), with this in mind, all you need to do is make a Quake directory, extract the darkplaces engine zip to that directory, then make a quake/id1 directory, and put the pak0.pak and pak1.pak from your Quake CD into the quake/id1 directory, then all should be well.

How to deal with a DOS Quake CD on Windows:
Try to use the DOS Quake installer if you can, use DOSBox if necessary to run the installer, then copy the pak0.pak and pak1.pak to your id1 directory in the darkplaces installation.  ( http://dosbox.sourceforge.net )

How to deal with a WinQuake CD on Windows:
Copy the D:\Data\id1\pak0.pak and pak1.pak to your id1 directory.

How to deal with a Linux Quake CD on Windows:
Find an archiver (perhaps 7zip or winrar) that can extract files from rpm archives, locate the pak files and copy them to your id1 directory.



How to install Quake on Linux:
All that DarkPlaces needs from the Quake CD is pak files, with this in mind, all you need to do is make a ~/quake directory, extract the darkplaces engine zip to that directory, then make a quake/id1 directory, and put the pak0.pak and pak1.pak from your Quake CD into the quake/id1 directory, then all should be well, you will probably also want to make a ~/bin/darkplaces script containing the following text:
#!/bin/sh
cd ~/quake
./darkplaces-sdl $*
Then do chmod +x ~/bin/darkplaces

For more information on Quake installation on Linux see http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Quake-HOWTO.html" (the Linux Quake How To)

How to deal with a DOS Quake CD on Linux:
cat /media/cdrom/resource.001 /media/cdrom/resource.002 >quake.lha
unlha x quake.lha
If you can't get unlha or lha for your distribution, try using DOSBox to run the Quake installer.

How to deal with a WinQuake CD on Linux:
Copy the /media/cdrom/data/id1/pak*.pak to your id1 directory.

How to deal with a Linux Quake CD on Linux:
mkdir temp
cd temp
# in the following line replace quake.rpm with a correct rpm filename
cat /media/cdrom/quake.rpm | rpm2cpio | cpio -i
Now you should have a mess of subdirectories, locate the pak files and copy to your id1 directory.
Alternatively if you have an rpm-based distribution you could install the rpm, but it is easier to maintain your ~/quake directory than /usr/share/games/quake so you may want to copy the id1/pak*.pak from there and uninstall the rpm.



How to install Quake on Mac OS X:
All that DarkPlaces needs from the Quake CD is pak files, with this in mind, make a folder named Quake, drag the Darkplaces.app into this Quake folder, make a folder inside the Quake folder (alongside Darkplaces) named id1, and put the pak0.pak and pak1.pak from your Quake CD into the quake/id1 directory, then all should be well, simply run the Darkplaces app

How to deal with a DOS Quake CD on Mac OS X:
Unknown.  Linux solution may work if you can get hold of lha, otherwise use DOSBox to run the Quake installer.

How to deal with a WinQuake CD on Mac OS X:
Find the data folder on the cdrom and copy the data/id1/pak*.pak files to your id1 folder.

How to deal with a Linux Quake CD on Mac OS X:
Unknown.  If you can get hold of rpm2cpio and cpio you should be able to follow the Linux method.

MoALTz for some bugfixes and cleanups
Joseph Caporale for adding 5 mouse button support.
KGB|romi for his contributions to the Quake community, including his rtlights project and many suggestions, his id1 romi_rtlights.pk3 is included in darkplaces mod releases.
Zombie for making great levels and general DarkPlaces publicity.
