# DarkPlaces Engine

DarkPlaces is a game engine based on the Quake 1 engine by id Software. It
improves and builds upon the original 1996 engine by adding modern rendering
features, and expanding upon the engine's native game code language QuakeC, as
well as supporting additional map and model formats.

Developed by LadyHavoc. See CREDITS.md for a list of contributors.

```
brew install sdl2 libjpeg-turbo libpng libvorbis curl
```

4. See [Unix instructions](#unix-(general)).
