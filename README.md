# DarkPlaces Engine

DarkPlaces is a game engine based on the Quake 1 engine by id Software. It
improves and builds upon the original 1996 engine by adding modern rendering
features, and expanding upon the engine's native game code language QuakeC, as
well as supporting additional map and model formats.

Developed by LadyHavoc. See [CREDITS](CREDITS.md) for a list of contributors.

## Build instructions (WIP)

### Required packages

The minimum SDL version is 2.0.18 for Linux and 2.24.0 for Windows.  
The following package names are for Debian, see below for Windows and Mac.

##### Client
Build (mandatory): `build-essential` `libjpeg-dev` `libsdl2-dev`  
Runtime (optional): `libcurl` `libpng` `libfreetype6` `libvorbisfile`  

##### Dedicated Server
Build (mandatory): `build-essential` `libjpeg-dev` `zlib1g-dev`  
Runtime (optional): `libcurl` `libpng`  

### Windows (MSYS2):

1. Install MSYS2, found [here](https://www.msys2.org/).
2. Once you've installed MSYS2 and have fully updated it, open a MinGW64 terminal (***not an MSYS2 terminal***) and input the following command:

```
pacman -S --needed gcc make mingw-w64-x86_64-{toolchain,libjpeg-turbo,libpng,libogg,libvorbis,SDL2}
```

3. See [Unix instructions](#unix-(general)).

### macOS
1. Open a terminal and input `xcode-select --install`
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
3. In the same (or a different terminal), input the following command:

```
brew install sdl2 libjpeg-turbo libpng libvorbis curl
```

4. See [Unix instructions](#unix-(general)).

### Unix (General)

From a terminal, in the engine's root directory, input `make`. On macOS, input `make` with a target such as `make sdl-release`.

Input `make help` for options.

If you get errors (that don't seem to be about missing dependencies) try `make clean` before compiling, especially if you updated your system since the last time you compiled.


### Windows (Visual Studio)

Instructions TODO.
