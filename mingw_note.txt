For compiling Darkplaces with MinGW, you need the following files which do not
come in the standard MinGW installation:
	- include/ddraw.h
	- include/dinput.h
	- include/dsound.h
They are part of the DirectX SDK but can also be found in the original release
of Quake 1 source code (ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/q1source.zip).

Assuming the MinGW binaries are in your PATH, you compile Darkplaces by typing
"make release". Note that "make" may be named "mingw32-make", so you may want
to try "mingw32-make release" if the first command fails to run.

For cross-compiling Win32 binaries on Linux using MinGW, you need to force the
makefile to use the MinGW compilation parameters, otherwise it will autodetect
the operating system it runs on and will use the corresponding parameters. You
can force it by appending "DP_MAKE_TARGET=mingw" at the end of the command line.
