/*
 * The VPK format is Valve's package format for Source engine games,
 * used to store game content.
 * 
 * Game content is spread across multiple VPK files. A single, special
 * VPK file, ending in _dir.vpk, contains a centralized directory
 * tree for all of the other files, and has its own header.
 * Although content can be stored in the directory file.
 * 
 * This is useful for navigating game content without having
 * to guess which VPK some file belongs to, while also
 * making game updates more efficient by spreading content
 * across multiple files, where opening and closing thousands
 * of loose files to update them is less efficient.
